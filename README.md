# 2021-Drive-Code

This is a library of code that is being developed to control a heavyweight combat robot named Mad Dog. 
This is a pneumatic flipper robot with a coaxial swerve drive that is being built by the combat robotics team at Kettering University.
Each subsystem in the robot is designed to be controlled by individual microcontrollers that recieve commands from a central control module over dual redundant I2C buses. 
We are currently using Teensy LC's with custom breakout board PCB's for each subsystem controller (4x swerve modules, 1 Pneumatics module) and a teensy 4.1 as the central module that distributes tasks.
This project is intended to follow the MIT license, so feel free to use any information and code for your own purposes, we only ask that you credit us as a source.


All of our code should also have enough comments to properly explain how it functions, but if you have any questions feel free to send me an email at howardbaerospace@gmail.com


Thanks for looking!
-Howard
